# HOI4 Rejuvenated!

Hello fellow war criminals! This mod is a large-scale overhaul/content mod in the same vein as The Road to 56. You can think of this mod like a friendly rival to it. It aims to overhaul a large amount of preexisting game content, as well add a great deal to it.

This is the full release version & will be updated every so often once new content is functional & ready to go! Due to the size & scope of this mod, said new content will be a continually ongoing effort, so it won't just be stopping here. Support is greatly appreciated! :)

Right now I'm working on a refresh of content for the USA, which I hope to have out for the next update.


## Specific Content

At present, notable content includes:

- Cuba Content - Full country content & focus tree. This is the very first one I did. Not perfect, but I'm still proud of it.
- Brazil Content - Full country content & focus tree. *Credit to VFacure of VF's Brazil for the base content & his passion for Brazil*
- Generic Focus Tree - A brand new generic focus tree. A good bit more interesting than the base game's!
- New States - All across the world, with the exception of Europe. From the Americas & Madagascar, to Indonesia, Malaysia, & New Zealand.
- Resource Updates - Many countries now have more realistic & functional resources. New Zealand & South Africa are the coal havens they historically were. Cuba has a hearty supply of steel, representing historical (& notable) iron & copper mining. Central America is no longer a single steel or chromium here or there. Liberia even gets some love with annual rubber growth!
- Base Mechanic Changes - Smaller airwings (may be adjusted with feedback), more dockyards per ship, faster naval transports, reduced energy demands, building adjustments, faster wargoal justifications (may be tweaked in the future), and more!
- Global Population Overhaul - Tired of a decent chunk of world population being missing? Thanos couldn't keep everyone away forever, & they've been restored! (Though some countries did lose excess population)
- Greater Caribbean Formable Nation - Some basic ideas of Caribbean unity floated around in the past. This is simply an expansion on that idea. Gain cores as any Caribbean sea-based country on all of Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Central America, Belize, & Yucatan!

## Other Features

- New Starting Countries - Malta, Madagascar, Cyprus, & Egypt. They don't have much to them yet, but it's a start.
- New Leaders
- Tech Tree Adjustments - Still in Progress
- Unit Adjustments - Armored Cars have been made far more affordable, & much better at scouting & a few terrains.
- Additional Sub-Ideologies - WIP
- Misc. Country Tweaks (such as annual Liberian rubber events).
- Building Updates - Electrical grids, for instance, are no longer mutually exclusive, & no longer use a shared building slot with factories.
- Division Icon Additions - Credit to Alkolotl - This is an incorporation of his mod: Overwhelming Division Icons.

## Future Plans

- Total Tech Tree Overhaul - Reworked current content, additional technology, etc.
- New Designers + Related Content/Tech - Mechanized, Armored Cars, Convoys, & Rockets.
- Rocketry Overhaul - Did you know they were already being researched & utilized by the end of the 20s?
- Intelligence Agency/Espionage Overhaul
- Unit Reworks
- New Army + Navy Leader Traits
- Doctrine Updates
- New Country Laws
- New Gamerules
- State Coring System - This will be based on a combination of compliance & applying political power.
- Region Development System (ability to upgrade a state's region type)
- Air, Army, & Naval Spirit reworks.
- Tech Sharing w/ Puppets
- More New Formables

## Misc. Information

This mod is still in it's proverbial infancy, & is thusly still lacking in content. I do most of the work myself right now that's making it into the main mod, including doing all of the mod's graphics at present. I can't do everything myself, & additional content takes time & volunteers.
