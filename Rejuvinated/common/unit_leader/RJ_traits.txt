#lucky = {

#		modifier = {
#			wounded_chance_factor = -0.4
#		}
#
#		new_commander_weight = {
#			factor = 1  
#			
#			modifier = {
#				is_army_leader = yes
#				FROM = { has_idea = best_of_the_best_spirit }
#				factor = 0
#			}
#			modifier = {
#				is_navy_leader = yes
#				FROM = { has_idea = best_of_the_best_naval_academy_spirit }
#				factor = 0
