Put ready focus icons that can be (and should be) shared between different trees here.
Claim your work in `attributions.yml`. You're not allowed to edit existing attributions, just add your own.

Do not copy other's people work without their consent.
Do not copy vanilla icons here.
Do not put assets or unfinished works or any other files other than .dds/.tga/.png focus icons here.
Consider prefixing your files with `RJ_` to maintain consistency and clarity.

Please remember that if you're using current version of genfocusgfx you still will have to manually edit generated .gfx file to load the icons directly from here, or duplicate it and replace an automatically generated placeholder.
Please do not edit the icons directly as they may be already used somewhere in the mod and it may lead to unintented changes. Instead make copies.
