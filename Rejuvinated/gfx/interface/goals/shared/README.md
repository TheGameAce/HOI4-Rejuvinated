This folder contains reusable focus icons intended for multiple focus trees. Follow the guidelines below when adding icons.

## Usage rules

Only place complete focus icons here (.dds, .tga, .png files)

Always verify that your changes do not unintentionally affect other focus trees using the same icons.

Do **not** include:
- Vanilla icons
- Unfinished assets or non-icon files
- Other authors' work without explicit permission

## Namming & Attribution
Consider prefixing your icon with `RJ_` for consistency

Claim authorship in `attributions.yml` - **do not modify existing entries.**

If an icon is used elsewhere in the mod, do not edit it directly. Instead, create a copy and modify that. 

## For genfocusgfx users
When generating placeholders, you must manually update the .gfx file to load icons from this directory, or duplicate and replace the generated placeholders accordingly.
