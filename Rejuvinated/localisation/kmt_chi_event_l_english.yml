This forbids the stationing of our army in and near Shanghai, preventing us from defending the area effectively should war breaks out.\n\nUnder our current policy of prioritising external threats, some of our officials suggest that we could stage an "incident" and use it as a cause for us to garrison more troops in the area.

 kmt.450.d:0 "A series of anti-Japanese vandalism was conducted by about 20 self-proclaimed "patriotic Chinese" in the Chapei District yesterday, seemingly encouraged by the recent increase in Chinese military presence in the city. Their actions have caused numerous loss of property for the local Japanese businessmen, the exact amount of damage inflicted is still under calculation.\n\nThe Japanese government has demanded we arrest all the the perpetrators in 24 hours and now the deadline has arrived. However, our police forces are only able to arrest three suspects. In spite of our "inefficiency" in protecting the property of the residents in Shanghai, the foreign powers that have concessions in Shanghai and the most vocal of them all, Japan, has demanded that we should handover the duty of maintaining local security to Japan.\n\nDoing so will effectively give Japan full control over Shanghai and severly undermines public support for our government."

 kmtccw.47.d1:0 "With the adamant [KMT_central_gov_tag.GetRulingParty] representatives holding onto their position on what to be included in the constitution, many present had deemed that the Assembly had reached an impass. As situation continued to deteriorate with arguements becoming more heated between representatives from the KMT and the CDSP, later even the YCP, it finally culminated in a mass exodus of dissatisfied attendees. In the end, the quorum was broken and the Assembly was adjourned indefinitely."

As situation continued to deteriorate with arguements becoming more heated between representatives from the KMT and the CCP, it finally culminated in an extremely disappointed Chou En-lai leading the rest of the CCP representatives out of the venue. Later, the CDL and the CDSP would also leave the Assembly and broke the quorum. The Assembly was at the end adjourned indefinitely."

 kmtccw.50.d:0 "In response to the foreign threat, [From.GetLeader] has decided that they should seize all of China before anyone else. They have begun attacking on all front, breaking the ceasefire agreement."

 kmtccw.55.d:0 "The [KMT_central_gov_tag.GetRulingParty] has already passed their authoritarian constitution before. If we are to truly liberalise and democratise China, or simply intending to derail the conference, a proposal to abolish said constitution would be mose appropriate."
