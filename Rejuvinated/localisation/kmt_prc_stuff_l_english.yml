 kns.4.d:0 "Joseph Stalin, former leader of the Soviet Union, was diagnosed with stroke, high blood pressure and gastric bleeding. He was found lying on the floor in his bedroom prior to doctors being called. Using leeches as treatment to no avail, Stalin's double was recalled from vacation to stand in as Stalin if needed. However, Stalin's health was later braodcasted throughout moscow in detail. The day after, Joseph Stalin was pronounced dead.\n\nStalin's cult of personality is expected to go on after his demise. And a power struggle has already underway as powerful members of the party are enthusiatic to rise to the vacant position left by Stalin."

He took his father's position after the Huang-ku-t'uan Incident in 1928 where Chang Tso-lin was assassinated by the Japanese. Soon afterwards he replaced the old Peiyang five-coloured flag with the Nanking nationalist government's white sun and blue sky over red earth flag, declaring his loyalty to them in the process.\n\nDuring the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Chang controversially ordered his troops to \"not resist\" the Japanese, leading to a rapid collapse of Chinese forces in Manchuria. This series of event earned him the nickname \"the general who did not resist\"."
