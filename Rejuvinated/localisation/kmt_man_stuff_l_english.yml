 jap.78.t:0 "Radical Propagation"

They force others to support their movements and those who do not would be given a sound beating. Some even reported that they break into pro-Japanese citizens' house and teach them some "lessons". If their practice continues, we will soon catch the Japanese's attention and the whole plan will be in peril."
 jap.78.a:0 "Let them continue their practice."
 jap.78.b:0 "Tell them to calm down."
 jap.79.t:0 "[MAN.GetLeader]'s Petty Scheme"
 jap.79.d:0 "Our investigators have found solid evidence about [MAN.GetLeader]'s petty scheme to break away from our control. We have sent an ultimatum to him requesting his immediate submission. If he dares not to comply, they shall meet the might of the mighty army of [Root.GetNameDef]!"

 jap.81.b:0 "Called for a halt of such practice."
 jap.82.t:0 "Anti-Japanese Assemblies"
 jap.82.d:0 "Assemblies aimed at driving out the Japanese have started at some areas in our land. Some have even turned into conflicts between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese citizens.

 jap.83.t:0 "Politicians Dislike Japanese"
 jap.83.d:0 "Some politicians have started to show disgust towards Japanese openly. Japanese officials within our government have been targets of attacks and blackmails.

 jap.84.t:0 "Military Dislikes Japanese"
 jap.84.d:0 "With the anti-Japanese craze going on in our nation, many people have started to express their disgust towards Japanese publicly, especially to those with power. This is no exception in the military. Recently some soldiers disobeyed orders from Japanese officers and beat up Japanese soldiers. These actions have caused unrest and chaos within the army and even armed conflicts between our men and the Kwantung Army. If we are to prevent these conflicts from escalating, the most effective way is to remove all Japanese presence in our military. However, such action would undoubtedly provoke the Japanese."

 jap.85.t:0 "Japanese Killed"

 jap.87.t:0 "Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Fighters"
 jap.87.d:0 "Some restorationists have funded paramilitary units to form guerrilla groups that periodically raid our overlord's military assets. So far they have only inflicted minimal damages, and our master's garrisons barely deem them any threat. Some consider such practice a waste of resources, but additional investments might help them make more progress."
 jap.87.a:0 "Allocate more resources for them."
 jap.87.b:0 "It is not worth it."
 jap.88.t:0 "Vandalism Against Japanese"
 jap.88.d:0 "Anti-Japanese fanatics have been vandalising Japanese properties lately, including stores, houses and even factory machineries. The estimated cost is still increasing.

 jap.88.b:0 "Send police to protect potential targets of vandalism."
 jap.89.t:0 "Bold Proposal"
 jap.89.d:0 "In a recent meeting of the restorationists, one of them had proposed a bold plan. However, some other have objected to his plan saying that it will increase the risk of compromising our actions. The duty of making the final decision has fallen onto [Root.GetLeader] after much debate."

Skirmishes have been observed in strategic points in the region and many civillians also decide to take up arms against the Japanese.

 # BOOKMARK #
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Aisin-Gioro P'u-i, the last emperor of the Great Qing, was evicted from his residence - the Forbidden Palace by the Kuomintang in 1924. And after the Mukden Incident, he agreed to assist the Japanese in establishing Manchukuo, hoping to become emperor once more.\n\nHe was ultimately disappointed, and deceived. With the most prominent Qing restorationist cum Manchukuo founder Cheng Hsiao-hsü under house arrest, and state affairs effectively controlled by the Kwantung Army, P'u-i is emperor merely in name. Yet the world is capricious, and he may yet to realise his imperial ambition..."
 MAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Sino-Japanese War rages on, causing immeasurable death and suffering. In stark contrast to the misery within China, Manchuria is a Paradise of the Kingly Way, where prosperity reigns and people live in harmony.\n\nOr so the propaganda depicts. In truth, the remaining NAJUA elements have been strengthened by the Chinese \"United Front\", and those who holds a firm grip on Manchukuo - the Kwantung Army and Japanese businesses - continue to exploit the locals for the benefits of the Japanese immigrants. Then again, being the \"lifeblood of the Empire\" does have its benefits."
