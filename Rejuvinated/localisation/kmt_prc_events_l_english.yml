However, his mere survival could potentially give strength to Wang Ming's rivals. With a precise and morbid order from our incumbent chairman, Chang Kuo-t'ao was escorted out of his residence, where he had been staying after his fall from grace, and publicly criticised and executed.\n\nHowever, with Mao Tse-tung still having major influence, it would require more time to bring the party to a stable state."
 PRC186D2:0 "As Mao Tse-tung's vision of the party's future having fewer and fewer supporters thanks to Wang Ming's vitriol, his influence within the party has waned to a degree where only a small few doggedly loyal individuals would still support this once charismatic and commanding figure. Despite being reduced to a mere shadow of his former self, Mao is in theory still capable of rallying masses behind his cause with ease. Such threat will not disperse unless he is removed completely, which has been ordered by chairman Wang.\n\nHowever, with Chang Kuo-t'ao still having major influence, it would require more time to bring the party to a stable state."

 prc.336.d:0 "After founding their so-called [From.From.GetFaction], they have been busy looking for allies within China to bolster their ranks. Unfortunately, [From.GetLeader] fails to see the benefits of the Treaty of Tokyo and has mistaken us for a national traitor and joined [From.From.GetLeader]'s treasonous rank."
 prc.336.a:0 "They are beyond saving."

 prc.337.t:0 "Inaction Criticised"
 prc.337.d:0 "Despite having called for an expedition to the east, [Root.GetLeader]'s later inaction and hindrance to the operation has caused the death of such plan. This inconsistency of policy exhibited by [Root.GetLeader] has greatly damaged his reputation."
 prc.337.a:0 "What was he cooking?"
 prc.338.t:0 "East Expedition Called Off"
 prc.338.d:0 "The bodies of soldiers littered across the mountains, yet the blood of the revolutionaries was spillt in vain. With only few goals achieved and a mounting casualty, the Central Committee has demanded the immediate cessation of the operation. The proponent of said operation, [Root.GetLeader], has been appropriately criticised for his supposed \"opportunism\"."
 prc.338.a:0 "A disaster."

 prc.342.t:0 "A New China"
 prc.342.d:0 "With our domiance over at least half of China affirmed, we should consider announcing to the world that we represent the only legitimate government of China. However, what shall we address ourselves with?"

 prc.343.t:0 "The Long March"
 prc.343.d:0 "After the disastrous Anti-Encirclement Campaign in Kiangsi in 1934, the Kiangsi Soviet Zones have most been captured. While some comrades like Chen I and Sü Yü stayed in Kiangsi due to various reasons and continue to conduct guerrilla warfare, most other retreated westwards.\n\nAfter seizing the town of Tsunyi in Kweiyang in January 1935, Mao and his allies criticised the former leadership comprising of the Internationalists Wang Ming, Po Ku, and Otto Braun for their disastrous command.\n\nAfter the Red Armies failed to take Kweiyang and retreated into Szechwan Province, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Mao Tse-tung started to disagree on where to settle their forces. While Mao argued to go north, Chang insisted on settling in Szechwan. This resulted in the First Red Army going north to Shensi alone, while the Fourth Army led by Chang stayed and later started criticising Mao.\n\nHowever, by early 1936, the Fourth and Second Red Army suffered disastrous defeats in Szechwan and internal pressure forced Chang Kuo-t'ao to abandon his "Northwest Bureau" and head up north to rendevoused with the First Red Army."
 prc.343.a:0 "Inspiring."
 prc.343.b:0 "A devastating blow to our revolutionary cause."
 prc.343.c:0 "Don't care."
 prc.344.t:0 "Chang Hsüeh-liang"
 prc.344.d:0 "Despite being appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the commander in chief of the \"Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarter\", Chang harbours hidden sympathy for our cause. He wishes to stop the civil war and intents to convince Chiang to focus the country's resources on defending against the Japanese threat instead. He also seems open to the idea of using force to make Chiang change his mind.\n\nPerhaps he could be of great use to our plans?"
 prc.344.a:0 "Perhaps."
 prc.344.b:0 "He did not resist the Japanese, why should we trust him?"
 prc.342.c:0 "What's so bad about [Root.GetName]?"
 
 prc.345.t:0 "Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact"
 prc.345.d:0 "The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact has presented us with a new situation, one where we have been \"advised\" by [SOV.GetNameDEF] to cease any guerrilla activities in Japanese-controlled Manchuria. We currently have no power to go against their orders, and must endure with this sudden turn for the worse."
 prc.345.a:0 "At least this will keep [SOV.GetNameDEF] safe from Japanese aggression."
