 cuba.1.t:0 "General Election"
 cuba.1.d:0 "It is now time for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people to be called to the polls to elect their leader.\nThis year, two main forces are present. The Tripartite coalition, composed of the Liberal Party, National Unity, & Republican Action, has the support of the many forces behind the 1933 revolution, particularly General Fulgencio Batista.\nAgainst them, the relatively conservative National Democratic Association, led by former President Mario García Menocal, who had led Cuba in particular during the First World War."
 cuba.1.a:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez"
 cuba_tripartite_coalition_party_long:0 "Coalición Tripartita"
 cuba.1.b:0 "Mario García Menocal"
 cuba_democratic_national_association_party_long:0 "Asociación Nacional Democrática"

 cuba.2.t:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez's Inauguration"
 cuba.2.d:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez was inaugurated as Cuba's seventh president following his election earlier this year.\nIdeologically supported by the forces behind the 1933 revolution, he intends to continue the social reforms implemented by successive administrations since Ramón Grau's 100-day government."
 cuba.2.a:0 "We act for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people."

 cuba.3.t:0 "Mario García Menocal's Inauguration"
 cuba.3.d:0 "Mario García Menocal was inaugurated as the seventh president of Cuba today, following his victory in the election earlier this year. Menocal is remembered for his time in office as the 3rd president of Cuba, being a strong ally of corporations & businesses. \n \n During his tenure, Menocal spent far in excess of the federal budget, leaving the country in over $40,000,000 of debt, & was accused of using fraud to win re-election in 1916. This in turn led to an unsuccessful revolt in the army, led by former president José Miguel Gómez. \n \n With Menocal back in power, it's sure to cause a new wave of instability & uncertainty in the days to come."
 cuba.3.a:0 "Let's hope for the best..."

 cuba.4.t:0 "Batista Marches on Havana!"
 cuba.4.d:0 "Declaring that Mario García Menocal's government betrayed not only the 1933 revolution but also the entire [CUB.GetAdjective] nation, Fulgencio Batista called on the army to oppose & overthrow the government.\nJ. Butler Wright, the [USA.GetAdjective] ambassador to [CUB.GetNameDef], announced that [USA.GetNameDef] supported the current government.\nThe Havana garrison has still not chosen sides but could well change everything."
 cuba.4.a:0 "The garrison sides with the government, & the coup fails."

 cuba_revolutionnary_party_long:0 "Partido Revolucionario Cubano"

 cuba.5.t:0 "President Gomez Impeached!"
 cuba.5.d:0 "Despite Miguel Mariano Gómez's promised extensive programs, he found himself with increasing opposition, particularly in the Congress & with the army chief, Fulgencio Batista, despite being his supporter during the election.\n\nFollowing the veto of the nine-cent law, Miguel Mariano Gómez was officially dismissed by Congress, & Vice-President Federico Laredo Brú was inaugurated as President of Cuba."
 cuba.5.a:0 "Let's hope he will meet the expectations of Congress & the people."

 cuba.6.t:0 "[CUB.GetNameDefCap] Suggests a War against Spain"
 cuba.6.d:0 "Declaring that the apparent neutrality that the Spanish regime is trying to show is in reality only a façade hiding secret aid to the war effort, the [CUB.GetAdjective] government has suggested a declaration of war against fascist Spain.\n\nSuch a declaration is not made lightly, especially against a currently neutral country. There is little doubt, however, that Spain's support is oriented towards the forces of the Axis."
 cuba.6.a:0 "It's time to avenge the Second Republic."
 cuba.6.b:0 "It would be too dangerous."

 cuba.7.t:0 "War with Spain Refused!"
 cuba.7.d:0 "Citing that the war is already long enough, a declaration of war against a country as big as Spain would only make it more brutal & murderous; our plan for a war against nationalist Spain has been rejected."
 cuba.7.a:0 "At least we tried."

 cuba.8.t:0 "Communist Sympathizers Attempt to Seize Power"
 cuba.8.d:0 "Many communist parties, including former exiles, have gathered in Santo Domingo today to demand the government's resignation & the establishment of a socialist system. They are very numerous & seem to have received foreign weapons."

 cuba.8.b:0 "The government holds on."

 cuba.9.t:0 "The [DOM.GetAdjective] Revolution Crushed"
 cuba.9.d:0 "Despite our support in terms of material, it seems that the [DOM.GetAdjective] revolutionaries failed to bring down the government. Those who were able to escape tell us that many of those present in Santo Domingo were arrested & may well end up executed. What should we do?"
 cuba.9.a:0 "If we cannot liberate them from the inside, we will do it from the outside!"
 cuba.9.b:0 "We will come back later."

 cuba.14.t:0 "What to do with Batista?"
 cuba.14.d:0 "Fulgencio Batista has been a controversial figure in Cuban politics, & exerts a great deal of influence throughout our country. This causes a great many issues for us, & thusly it's in our best interests to find a solution to the problems he causes; the sooner the better."
 cuba.14.a:0 "Exile Batista"
 cuba.14.b:0 "Compromise With Batista"

 cuba.15.t:0 "Proposal for Hispaniolan Unification"

 cuba.15.a:0 "Accept the Proposal"
 cuba.15.b:0 "Decline the Proposal"

 cuba.16.t:0 "Caribbean Unity?"
 cuba.16.d:0 "Fulgencio Batista's government has approached us with a proposal for greater cooperation, through the rule of one government in the Caribbean isles. While this would mean we give up our own power, it would certainly strengthen & unify the Caribbean."
 cuba.16.a:0 "A good proposal. We accept!"
 cuba.16.b:0 "We prefer to maintain our autonomy."

 cuba.17.t:0 "Cuban Sugar for Oil?"
 cuba.17.d:0 "The Cuban government has come to us with a very tempting offer. As one of a limited number of sugar sources, they're offering us a steady supply of sugar in exchange for some of our oil. Shall we accept?"
 cuba.17.a:0 "A good deal. We accept!"
 cuba.17.b:0 "Oil is worth more to us than sugar right now."
