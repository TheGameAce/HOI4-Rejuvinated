 ### EVENT DESCRIPTIONS ###
 iceland_events.27d:0 "The sun rises on a foggy day in Reykjavik, the capial is busy with shops and parks. Children playing, old people feeding birds on the plentiful benches in the main square. On the government building; An Icelandic pennant flowing quietly beside the Danish pennant. Government officials bicker and plan inside the building. Eventually a group of them walk out announcing the new polling station for independence. An unexpected suprise for the people walking along side the pathways on the beautiful fjord ridden coast. The people of Reykjavik flock to the polling stadium full of questions, when a figure walks out on the podium. The prime minister of Iceland; Hermann Jónasson. He prepares some papers and begins his speech.

 "Fellow people of Iceland, for which I will give my life for; I hereby announce the establishment of nationwide polling stations for the independence of out great nation. Hopefully this shall lead to us forging our own way on the current world stage. As the governor and leader of Iceland, I announce my official support for the independence of Iceland!""
