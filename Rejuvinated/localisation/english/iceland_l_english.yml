 iceland.1.d:0 "The sun rises on a foggy day in Reykjavik, on the government building; An Icelandic pennant flowing quietly beside the Danish pennant. Government officials bicker and plan inside the building. Eventually a group of them walk out announcing the new polling station for independence. An unexpected surprise for the people walking along side the pathways on the beautiful fjord ridden coast, for a lot of them are just walking and feeding birds - like any normal day. The people of Reykjavik flock to the polling stadium full of questions, when a figure walks out on the podium. The prime minister of Iceland: Hermann Jónasson. He prepares some papers and begins his speech.\n\n'Fellow countrymen of Reykjavík, for which I will give my life for: I hereby announce the establishment of nationwide polling stations for the independence of our great nation.
