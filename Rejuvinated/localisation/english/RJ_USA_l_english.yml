 RJ_USA_the_american_popular_front:0 "The American Popular Front"
 RJ_USA_the_american_popular_front_desc:0 "The premise of the Popular Front is that we have enough in common with the liberals & progressives to work with them, & them with us. By reaching out to & working with these elements of American society, we can strengthen our own position & gain a manner of security & favor with traditionally democratic elements."
 RJ_USA_stamp_out_the_silver_legion:0 "Stamp Out the Silver Legion"
 RJ_USA_stamp_out_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion has caused enough troubles for us! Now that we're in charge, it's high time that we stamp them out. For the good of our party, & for the good of our nation!"
 RJ_USA_spread_our_ideals:0 "Spread Our Ideals"
 RJ_USA_spread_our_ideals_desc:0 "As we come together under the banner of American Socialism, we should extend this banner to those less fortunate than us. A gift like this must be shared with the world!"
 RJ_USA_taft_hartley_act:0 "Taft-Hartley Act"
 RJ_USA_taft_hartley_act_desc:0 "The National Labor Relations Act was signed into law by FDR in 1935. It provided far too much leniance to unions & their activities, which they've already taken the opportunity to abuse! The Taft-Hartley act will amend the NLRA, putting an end to unfair labor practices."
 RJ_USA_foreign_agents_registration_act:0 "Foreign Agents Registration Act"
 RJ_USA_foreign_agents_registration_act_desc:0 "Many come into our country with the intent to influence, or perhaps even destabilize, our country. Unfortunately they blend in with those acting in good faith. Due to this, it's in our best interests to have manditory registration for such foreign individuals, giving us better security with the knowledge of who's entering our borders. It will make it substantially harder for foreign agents to gain a foothold."
 RJ_USA_expand_the_bureau_of_mines:0 "Expand the Bureau of Mines"
 RJ_USA_expand_the_bureau_of_mines_desc:0 "The Bureau of Mines was originally established in 1910 with the goal of enhancing the efficiency & safety of mining operations in the United States. Expanding this bureau & increasing it's funding will provide an avenue for enhancing our current mining techniques & equipment, benefitting both the workers & the corporations."
 RJ_USA_establish_the_cmr:0 "Establish the CMR"
 RJ_USA_establish_the_cmr_desc:0 "By establishing a Committee for Medical Research, we can make much greater strides in the field of medicine, which should be of good benefit to both our citizens & troops!"
 RJ_USA_repeal_the_chinese_exclusion_act:0 "Repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act"
 RJ_USA_repeal_the_chinese_exclusion_act_desc:0 "The Chinese Exclusion Act is an abhorrent & outdated law, discriminating against Chinese citizens that would seek shelter in our country. It's time to end it once & for all!"
 RJ_USA_military_collaboration:0 "Military Collaboration"
 RJ_USA_military_collaboration_desc:0 "We have a great deal we can learn from the Soviet Union, & they have a great deal they can teach us. Allowing our top military leaders to collaborate together will benefit both sides, strengthening our tactics!"
 RJ_USA_doctrinal_refinements:0 "Doctrinal Refinements"
 RJ_USA_doctrinal_refinements_desc:0 "As our navy continues to expand & new ship technologies develop, we need to refine our current doctrines a bit further, accommodating newer elements such as carriers & submarine warfare. We can't be left insufficiently prepared in the event of war!"
 RJ_USA_wolfpack_tactics:0 "Wolfpack Tactics"
 RJ_USA_wolfpack_tactics_desc:0 "The modern age of the navy has introduced us to a new, stealthier, form of warfare: Submarine Raids. One of the proposed strategies is using 'wolfpack' style tactics: Sending our submarines out in small, well-coordinated groups to ambush enemy ships & convoys."
 RJ_USA_carrier_taskforces:0 "Carrier Taskforces"
 RJ_USA_carrier_taskforces_desc:0 "It's become clear to us that our carriers can no longer simply function as forward scouts, but as a key component of taskforce composition! By grouping them together with a strong screening force, we can coordinate effectively between air, sea, & land!"
 RJ_USA_combat_information_center:0 "Combat Information Center"
 RJ_USA_combat_information_center_desc:0 "With advancements in a number of fields including radar, as well as our now refined carrier tactics, we've developed the ability to give commanders, both on sea & land, a massive strategic advantage. This has become particularly effective at dealing with night-time conditions!"

 rj_usa.1.d:0 "The Silver Legion has been a largely lethargic & ineffectual organization, having fallen to a mere 5,000 members nation-wide in recent times. But with our latest actions, we've legitamized some of their claims, which has allowed them to begin growing their support. They've begun holding rallies in various states, especially in the south.
